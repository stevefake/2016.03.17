#Find Names
##Description

##Create a method which finds a person's name in an array of strings.

##Instructions

You are the NSA. Given how sneaky you are, you have access to a very large array of text messages that all people have sent to each other. You also have a name which is on one of your watch lists, and you want to see if that name appears in any of the text messages.

Write a method which takes a string (the name on the watch list) and an array of strings (the text messages). Return all the text messages which have the name somewhere inside them. Ideally, the search should be case insensitive, and should only look for whole words.

Just to be clear, if you are searching for "Clinton", text messages with "Clinton" or "clinton" ANYWHERE in them should be returned (e.g. "mr. clinton is 1337"). However, text messages like "Clintonian" should NOT be returned.

HOURS ESTIMATES:

(~1 hour) Create a new department (given its name).
(~15 min) Create a new employee (given his/her name, email address, phone number, and salary).
(~20 min) Add an employee to a department.
(~20 min) Get an employee's name.
(~10 min) Get an employee's salary.
(~10 min) Get a department's name.
(~20 min) Get a total salary for all employees in a department.
(~20 min) Add some employee review text (a paragraph or two) to an employee.
(~20 min) Mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily or not satisfactorily.
(~20 min) Give a raise to an individual. You decide if this makes sense in dollars or in percent.
(~30 min) Give raises to a department's employees. You must pass this method a total dollar amount, and it must distribute the raise amounts reasonably to the department's employees. Only employees who are performing satisfactorily should get raises.
Commit your code after you complete each requirement (or more often).

Finally, all of this code must be written using test-driven development. Your test suite should have at least one complete example of how the two classes can be used in the real world.
